# NTHU_ML-HW2

In this assignment we are going to build a machine learning model to predict the 30-day mortality of patients using eletronic health record (EHR).
That is, whether a patient will die in the hospital within 30 days.

There are 1,834 patients in the training dataset and each with a unique ID and 47 attributes.

I implement several models, such as XGboost, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, support vector machine, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, ComplementNB, MultinomialNB, GaussianNB, provide by sklearn library.
